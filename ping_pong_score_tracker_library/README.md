These files are for the ping_pong_score_tracker project.

I made a library for it because I have both the BlueController and the RedController, which both require these libraries

There was no point in copying the code to both folders so I made a library

Note: the code seen here in GitHub is just a copy of the library. the real location is in Arduino/libraries. it must be at that location to work
